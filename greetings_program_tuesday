"""
Level: Advanced: The greeting program.

Make a program that has your name and the current day of the week
stored as separate variables, and then prints a message like this:

“Good day <name>! <day> is a perfect day to learn some Python.”

Note that <name> and <day> are predefined variables in the source
code.
An additional option would be to use different string formatting
methods for constructing the result string.
